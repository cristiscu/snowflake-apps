# Snowflake Apps

All demo code for my ***Deploying a Python Application in Snowflake Hands-On*** Udemy course.

## Quick Environment Setup

(1) Create a **free Snowflake trial account** at [signup.snowflake.com](https://signup.snowflake.com/).

(2) Download and install [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your local machine.

(3) Download and install [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

(4) After you install Git, call **```git clone https://github.com/cristiscu/snowflake-apps.git```** to get my free GitHub repo into a new **snowflake-apps** local subfolder. Then open this subfolder from VSCode.

(5) In a Terminal window from VSCode, create (once only!) a Python virtual environment with **```python -m venv venv```**.

(6) Activate this environment with **```venv/scripts/activate```**.

(7) Install all required Python libraries for this course with **```pip install -r requirements.txt```**.

(8) For each lecture, locate and switch to the appropriate subfolder. Use those files as instructed in the course.
